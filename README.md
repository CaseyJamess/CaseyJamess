✨ Recently, I've developed a strong passion for web development and I'm eager to transition into the front-end development field.

🔥 My Interest in web development sparked when I was tasked with redesigning the test procedure at Protec Fire Detection.
   I uitlised modern web-dev technologies to design and incorporate a fully interactive user interface to factory test and program electronic devices.
